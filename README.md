# Issue Tracker

An efficient issue tracking application designed to create, manage, and resolve issues. This project demonstrates how to build a task management system using modern web development tools and technologies.

## Features

- **Issue Management**: Create, view, and manage issues.
- **Dynamic Frontend**: Rendered using EJS templates.
- **Backend**: Built with Express.js for server-side routing and logic.
- **Database**: Uses MongoDB with Mongoose for schema modeling and data storage.
- **Environment Configurations**: Configured using `dotenv` for secure environment variables.
- **Middleware**:
  - `cookie-parser` for handling cookies.
  - `cors` for managing cross-origin resource sharing.
- **Live Development**: `nodemon` for automatic server restarts during development.
